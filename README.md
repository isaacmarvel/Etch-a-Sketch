Odin Project Assignment
Instructions:
create a webpage with a 16x16 grid divs in a container div with js. 

Set up a hover effect so divs change color when mouse passes over them, leaving a trail. Happens when mouse enters a div and ends when mouse leaves it. Can set event listeners for either of those events as a starting point.

Change color by adding new class to div, or changing divs background color with js. 

Add button to top that clears grid and sends a popup asking for number of squares per side for new grid. Should be in same total space as before so you've got a new pad. Tip: max at 100 prolly. 
    research button tags in html and how you can make js functions run when clicked. Also prompts. Should be able to enter 64 and have the grid popup without changing the total pixel size.

Optional: instead of color from black to write, have each pass change to random rgb value. Then each pass adds another 10% black to it, so after 10 passes the square becomes black.
